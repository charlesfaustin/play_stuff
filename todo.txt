current setup blocks whilst file is created. not good.
so we are gonna hand it off to an actor for background processing

* create new model , call it created_files or something
* has one string for now , which is the full filepath to the created file

*file is created with akka
*initial filename is uuid string(already done), an object is created for this as soon as the file is made.
*its id string will be the same uuid this means the filename can be changed, and still found with the id string


********* for later ********
*template can then do a similar javascript json thing to show the created files available for download
*maybe do a notification with a websocket so the page doesnt have to be reloaded
