Do the websocket examples from before one by one, we will use an actor websocket eventually to receive messages back

******THEN*******
*add  websocket action to start background processing, and "flashing message" (with websockets tho) to let user know the processing is underway

*create ONE websocket actor that will handle messages to actors to generate files, push newly created files to browser etc

browser -> websocket actor -> filecreate actor -> websocket actor -> browser
// I saved an example of passing messages back to actor websockets senders somewhere in the other branch

on page load, one fetch command via websocket to show all currently created files at time of page load
pushes to browser will add updates



********* for later ********
dragula stuff to change the order



********* for later ********
*then later, push based websocket, to push newly created files to browser, if they were made after the page loaded.
*will require added a date created to the objects, and a date initialised to the controller actor/whatever
*will prolly use a scheduled action thing to query the db and do the pushing
*obv this is only done if the websocket connection is still open
*will have to install jodaTime at this point

********* for later ********
*template can then do a similar jav
ascript json thing to show the created files available for download
*maybe do a notification with a websocket so the page doesnt have to be reloaded
